how will i handle "table filling"?:
    file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/pamini/Desktop/fuzzing/info/00002759.html
    perhaps add a s_repeat:
    
    if s_block_start("table entry"):
        s_string("XXXX")
        ...
        s_block_end()
    
    # defaults to none, mutates up to 200 times the valid entry of table entry.
    s_repeat(from=0, to=200, block_name="table entry")
    

general
    - examine codenomicon VoIP fuzzer test cases and see if we are missing anything important
    - review codenomicon whitepaper
    - build VoIP fuzzer and compare with codenomicon (would make for a great talk slide, code coverage comparison)
    - add SPIKE aliases and test if it's actually SPIKE compatible.

blocks/primitives
    - implement fixed length padded strings
    - implement string size reduction for UDP protocol?? (or does it just span multiple packets)?
    - delim primitive: more space substitutions?

expector
    - add binning of pcaps, maybe as an outside tool?
    - add mkdir calls to prefix of pcap path

debugger (aka nanny)
    - write it ;-)
    - how will i implement the feedback loop?

vmware_control (aka daddy)
    - write it ;-)

sessions
    - graph math to figure out mutation counts
    - "honing", subsets of mutation ranges to locate the actual source of the crash

legos
    - finish ndr_string
    - add other ndr types
    - ip address (with limited entries from string / delim fuzz libraries) values.
        - multiple dots
        - dots with interspersed spaces (file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/pamini/Desktop/fuzzing/info/00000524.html)

        - negative numbers!
        - big numbers
        - long zero prefixes (check out the fuzz cases after 530)
        - automatically revert to valid target ip address
    - dns hostname
        - replace dots with string length
        - for fuzzing, try and create infinite recursion
    - complete tag (open, data, close)
